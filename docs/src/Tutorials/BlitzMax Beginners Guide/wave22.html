<tr><td class="idx2" colspan="2">
To get you started I have laid up a simple game-plan:<p>
1. Start small.. Think up a small and simple game.<p> 
2. Draw and write down your game on paper.<p>
3. Plan functions, type structures. If this is your first game make it a simple one!<p> 
4. Go to the forums and ask around if you have any questions, ask what others think about your game plan.<p> 
5. Now start coding, set up a small model and test run. Then add more as you go. Comment on every type, function and method that you write!<p>
6.  If a part of your game can be done separate (like explosions, map creation). Do a small *.bmx which tests these types/functions. In this way your have a bigger chance of catching evil bugs.<p> 
7. Don't start on your second project until your finish your first.<p> 

The plan you make for your "first game project" will most likely come out as "to big" so try to cut down on it.<br>
Make it a complete but small game.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="cap" colspan="2">Get Debug Help</td></tr>
<tr><td class="idx2" colspan="2"> 
When you encounter problems try to get help at the <a href="http://www.blitzmax.com/Community/_index_.php" target="_blank">Blitz Commumity Forums</a>. For people to be able to help you it's important that you know what your problem actually is, so think about it, try to narrow it down.<p>
Is it a compile error?<br>
Is something not showing up as expected?<br>
Check your variables, are they what they are supposed to be?<br>
Use Debugstop() or Waitkey on a line to see if that line is read, if it is your game will stop there.<br>
Don't forget a most important command ­ <span class="hy">&nbsp;Debuglog </span>&nbsp; which allows you to write text to the runtimelog.</td></tr>
